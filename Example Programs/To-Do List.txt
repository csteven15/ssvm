COMPLETE-does LA support read, write, and it definietely needs odd.
	+Yes, LA does support them all now.

COMPLETE-implement else
	+This is not required, and actually not even allowed in this project.

-redundant enforcement of identifier lengths

-what about that nullsym tho
	+Just don't tbh

error 9 sample code
not sure what error 17 means since its already covered?
error 18 not working correctly, should be do expected, not missing period
error13 isn't working. showing wrong error. semicolon or comma missing instead of assignment operator line 742
change     while (getTokenType(curToken) == plussym || getTokenType(curToken) == minussym)      to where it detects error if it is not a plussym or minussym
fix error 24
fix error 31
CHANGES
added statement error line 893 with else error(7) but then error(9) won't work correcty
check if it is eqaul symbol before checking for become symbol line 738
line 770, added semicolon error between statements error(10)




Revised To-Do List:

-Enforce max rc can be is 16; If it ever hit 17, that implies we are trying to store something in spot 16, which doesn't exist
	+Ok. Done.

-Enforce undeclared variable error
	+Ok. This is now enforced!

-Figure out where address counter should actually start and incrementing scheme...
	+Ok? Like, it runs programs without procedures properly, I don't really know what else to do with this...

-Maybe add a divide by 0 check...

-Maybe add redundant enforcement of identifier and number length caps
